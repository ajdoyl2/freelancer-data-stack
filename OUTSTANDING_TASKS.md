## 🎯 Success Criteria for Current Sprint

- [ ] **At least 2 production data sources** connected via Meltano
- [ ] **End-to-end pipeline** runs successfully with real data
- [ ] **Production Streamlit dashboards** deployed and accessible
- [ ] **Basic monitoring** and alerting operational
- [ ] **All integration tests** passing with real data flows

## 🔍 Current Blockers & Risks

### 🚫 Immediate Blockers
1. **Client data access permissions** - Need credentials/API keys for production sources
2. **Business requirements clarity** - Dashboard specifications and KPIs needed
3. **Production infrastructure** - Cloud resources and deployment strategy

### ⚠️ Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Data source access delays | High | Medium | Early stakeholder engagement, mock data preparation |
| Performance at scale | High | Low | Incremental load testing, monitoring setup |
| Service dependencies | Medium | Medium | Health monitoring, fallback strategies |

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Overall Readiness: **68% Complete**
| Category | Status | Completion | Next Action |
|----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Core Pipeline** | ✅ Ready | 95% | Production data integration |
| **Orchestration** | ✅ Ready | 90% | Airflow workflow creation |
| **Development** | ✅ Ready | 100% | Maintain and optimize |
| **Infrastructure** | ✅ Ready | 85% | Production deployment |
| **Analytics/Viz** | 🚧 Partial | 60% | Dashboard development |
| **Data Integration** | 🚧 Partial | 40% | Source connector setup |

## 📅 Next Review Items

### For Next Planning Session
1. **Prioritize data source connections** based on business value
2. **Define dashboard requirements** with stakeholders
3. **Plan production deployment** strategy and timeline
4. **Schedule comprehensive testing** with production data
5. **Review security** and compliance requirements

### Weekly Checkpoint Questions
- Are we unblocked on data source access?
- Do we have clear business requirements for dashboards?
- Is the production environment provisioning on track?
- Are there any new technical risks or dependencies?
