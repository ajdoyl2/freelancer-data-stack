## FEATURE:

- evaluate each tool in the docker-compose.yml file to make sure they are all working and working together.
- fix any image issues with the tools.
- simulate a full stack build and run of the docker-compose.yml file.
- make sure the agents are all working and working together.
- make sure there is an easy way to interact with the agents, like a CLI.
- make sure the agents can interact with the docker stack.
- use the transactions.csv file with the agents to have them use the stack to ingest the data, model the data, and then create a dashboard using streamlit and evidence.dev
