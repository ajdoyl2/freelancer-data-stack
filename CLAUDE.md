### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Use venv_linux** (the virtual environment) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.


### üß± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  For agents this looks like:
    - `agent.py` - Main agent definition and execution logic
    - `tools.py` - Tool functions used by the agent
    - `prompts.py` - System prompts
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use python_dotenv and load_env()** for environment variables.


### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case


### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.


### üìé Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Use Poetry** for dependency management.
- **Use Docker** for containerization.
- **Use GitHub** for version control.
- **Use GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.
- **Use SQL, Jinja, YAML, and Python** as language for analytics engineering (dbt)
- **Use Python and SQL** as language for data engineering
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**.
- Use `FastAPI` for APIs and `SQLAlchemy` or `SQLModel` for ORM if applicable.
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```


### üìö Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.
- `PRPs/ai_docs/` contains curated Claude Code documentation for context injection
- `claude_md_files/` provides framework-specific CLAUDE.md examples

### üß† AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.


## Core Architecture


### Command-Driven System

- **28+ pre-configured Claude Code commands** in `.claude/commands/`
- Commands organized by function:
  - `PRPs/` - PRP creation and execution workflows
  - `development/` - Core development utilities (prime-core, onboarding, debug)
  - `code-quality/` - Review and refactoring commands
  - `rapid-development/experimental/` - Parallel PRP creation and hackathon tools
  - `git-operations/` - Conflict resolution and smart git operations


### Template-Based Methodology

- **PRP Templates** in `PRPs/templates/` follow structured format with validation loops
- **Context-Rich Approach**: Every PRP must include comprehensive documentation, examples, and gotchas
- **Validation-First Design**: Each PRP contains executable validation gates (syntax, tests, integration)


## Development Commands


### PRP Execution

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended for development)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --interactive

# Headless mode (for CI/CD)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --output-format json

# Streaming JSON (for real-time monitoring)
uv run PRPs/scripts/prp_runner.py --prp [prp-name] --output-format stream-json
```


### Key Claude Commands

- `/prp-base-create` - Generate comprehensive PRPs with research
- `/prp-base-execute` - Execute PRPs against codebase
- `/prp-planning-create` - Create planning documents with diagrams
- `/prime-core` - Prime Claude with project context
- `/review-staged-unstaged` - Review git changes using PRP methodology


## Critical Success Patterns


### The PRP Methodology

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance


### Validation Gates (Must be Executable)

```bash
# Level 1: Syntax & Style
ruff check --fix && mypy .

# Level 2: Unit Tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Level 3: Integration
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/endpoint -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{...}'

# Level 4: Deployment
# mcp servers, or other creative ways to self validate
```


## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- L Don't create minimal context prompts - context is everything - the PRP must be comprehensive and self-contained, reference relevant documentation and examples.
- L Don't skip validation steps - they're critical for one-pass success - The better The AI is at running the validation loop, the more likely it is to succeed.
- L Don't ignore the structured PRP format - it's battle-tested
- L Don't create new patterns when existing templates work
- L Don't hardcode values that should be config
- L Don't catch all exceptions - be specific


## Working with This Framework


### When Creating new PRPs

1. **Context Process**: New PRPs must consist of context sections, Context is King!
2.


### When Executing PRPs

1. **Load PRP**: Read and understand all context and requirements
2. **ULTRATHINK**: Create comprehensive plan, break down into todos, use subagents, batch tool etc check prps/ai_docs/
3. **Execute**: Implement following the blueprint
4. **Validate**: Run each validation command, fix failures
5. **Complete**: Ensure all checklist items done


### Command Usage

- Read the .claude/commands directory
- Access via `/` prefix in Claude Code
- Commands are self-documenting with argument placeholders
- Use parallel creation commands for rapid development
- Leverage existing review and refactoring commands


### üöÄ PRP (Product Requirements Planning) Enhancement

#### Context Engineering Principles
- **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and gotchas in PRPs
- **Information Dense**: Use specific action verbs (MIRROR, COPY, ADD, MODIFY, DELETE, RENAME, MOVE, REPLACE, CREATE)
- **Validation Loops**: Progressive validation with executable commands (syntax ‚Üí unit ‚Üí integration ‚Üí creative)
- **One-Pass Implementation**: Comprehensive context enables successful first-pass implementation

#### PRP Creation Workflow
- **Research Phase**: Use parallel agents for comprehensive codebase and external research
- **Context Synthesis**: Combine research findings into implementation blueprint
- **Validation Gates**: Include executable commands for quality assurance
- **Quality Scoring**: Rate PRPs on 1-10 scale for implementation confidence

#### Enhanced Command Library
- **49 Total Commands**: 21 existing data stack + 28 integrated PRPs-agentic-eng commands
- **Domain Preservation**: All data stack commands maintain exact functionality
- **New Capabilities**: Advanced PRP creation, conflict resolution, code review automation
- **TypeScript Support**: Specialized TypeScript development workflows

#### Template Enhancements
- **prp_base_enhanced.md**: Enhanced base template with validation loops
- **prp_planning.md**: Visual planning with Mermaid diagrams
- **prp_spec.md**: Technical specification template
- **prp_task.md**: Task-based development template

#### Utility Integration
- **prp_runner.py**: Automated PRP execution with multiple output formats
- **AI Documentation**: 13 curated Claude Code documentation files in PRPs/ai_docs/
