# Execute AI Data Stack PRP

Run through a task list from an existing AI agent data stack PRP.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load Tasks**
   - Read PRP task list from specified file
   - Understand project context and architecture
   - Validate prerequisites (Docker, Python 3.11+)

2. **Execute Each Task Sequentially**
   - Perform ACTION (implementation)
   - Run VALIDATE (testing and verification)
   - Fix IF_FAIL issues (error handling and retries)
   - Update TodoWrite with progress

3. **AI Agent Integration**
   - Use DataStackEngineer agent for infrastructure tasks
   - Leverage automated deployment and validation scripts
   - Apply cost optimization and performance monitoring

4. **Complete Checklist**
   - Verify all tasks completed successfully
   - Run comprehensive validation suite
   - Check no regressions in existing functionality
   - Generate final deployment report

## Validation Framework

- **Level 1**: Syntax & style validation
- **Level 2**: Unit tests for all components
- **Level 3**: End-to-end integration testing
- **Data Quality**: 85%+ threshold validation
- **Performance**: Benchmark compliance

## Success Criteria

- All PRP tasks completed and validated
- Data stack deployable with single command
- Cost target achieved (~$50/month)
- Production-ready with monitoring and alerting

Work through tasks sequentially with comprehensive validation at each step.
