# MCP Server Research Executive Summary

## Research Findings

### Available MCP Servers
We identified 3 existing MCP servers that directly support our data stack:

1. **MotherDuck/DuckDB MCP Server** ⭐️ 241 stars
   - Official server from MotherDuck team
   - Written in Python
   - Actively maintained (last update: Jan 2025)
   - Supports both cloud and local DuckDB instances

2. **DataHub MCP Server** ⭐️ 41 stars
   - Official server from Acryl Data (DataHub creators)
   - Written in Python
   - Recently released (Jan 2025)
   - Comprehensive metadata management capabilities

3. **Snowflake MCP Server**
   - Community-developed
   - Provides secure Snowflake database access
   - Full query and schema management support

### Missing Components
Two critical components lack MCP server support:
- **dbt**: No existing MCP server
- **Dagster**: No existing MCP server

## Evaluation Results

### Top Performers
1. **MotherDuck/DuckDB** - Best overall choice
   - ✅ Official support
   - ✅ High performance
   - ✅ Active community (241 stars)
   - ✅ Easy integration

2. **DataHub** - Best for metadata management
   - ✅ Official from vendor
   - ✅ Comprehensive features
   - ✅ Data lineage support
   - ✅ Recent release

3. **Snowflake** - Essential for cloud data warehouse
   - ✅ Production-ready
   - ✅ Community tested
   - ✅ Secure implementation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)
1. **Deploy MotherDuck/DuckDB MCP Server**
   - Primary analytics engine
   - Local development and cloud production support

2. **Deploy DataHub MCP Server**
   - Metadata catalog foundation
   - Data lineage tracking

3. **Test Snowflake MCP Server**
   - Evaluate security and performance
   - Plan production deployment

### Short-term Development (Week 3-4)
1. **Design dbt MCP Server**
   - Critical for transformation workflows
   - Focus on core commands: run, test, compile
   - Leverage dbt-core Python API

2. **Design Dagster MCP Server**
   - Essential for orchestration
   - Use GraphQL API for integration
   - Start with basic job triggering

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Deploy existing servers
   - Set up development environment
   - Configure authentication
   - Basic integration testing

2. **Phase 2**: Custom development
   - dbt server prototype
   - Dagster server prototype
   - Integration testing

3. **Phase 3**: Production rollout
   - Security hardening
   - Performance optimization
   - Monitoring setup

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: MotherDuck, DataHub (official support)
- **Medium Risk**: Snowflake (community support)
- **High Risk**: Custom dbt/Dagster servers (development effort)

## Success Metrics
- All 5 data stack components accessible via MCP
- Query response time < 2 seconds
- 99.9% availability
- Zero security incidents

## Budget Considerations
- Existing servers: Minimal cost (open source)
- Custom development: 2-4 weeks developer time
- Infrastructure: Standard compute requirements

## Conclusion
The MCP ecosystem provides strong support for 3 out of 5 data stack components. Custom development for dbt and Dagster will complete the integration, enabling full AI-powered data stack management through standardized protocols.
