name: "CLAUDE.md Data Stack Enhancement - Comprehensive Tool Documentation"
description: |

## Purpose

Transform CLAUDE.md from basic Python development guidelines to comprehensive data stack documentation covering all 45+ components, tool-specific best practices, integration patterns, and AI agent development guidelines to align with the sophisticated AI agent-driven data stack actually implemented.

## Core Principles

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation for 45+ data stack components with real codebase examples
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable validation commands for each tool and integration
3. **Information Dense**: Use patterns and configurations from actual project implementation
4. **Progressive Success**: Organize by complexity and functional layers for easy navigation

---

## Goal

Create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md that documents all data stack components with tool-specific best practices, integration patterns, cost optimization strategies, and AI agent development guidelines to provide complete project context for development teams.

## Why

- **Context Gap**: Current CLAUDE.md covers <30% of actual project complexity (missing 28+ data stack tools)
- **Developer Onboarding**: New developers need comprehensive tool documentation for 45+ components
- **Cost Optimization**: Need to embed $50/month target strategies across all tool configurations
- **AI Agent Development**: Missing Pydantic AI patterns and agent architecture guidelines
- **Integration Patterns**: Need documentation of tool relationships and dependencies
- **Production Readiness**: Missing deployment, monitoring, and operations documentation

## What

Complete transformation of CLAUDE.md to include:
- Comprehensive documentation for all 45+ data stack components
- Tool-specific best practices with real configuration examples
- AI agent development patterns using Pydantic AI framework
- Cost optimization strategies embedded throughout
- Integration patterns and dependency relationships
- Production deployment and monitoring guidance

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All 45+ data stack components documented with best practices
- [ ] Each tool section includes configuration examples from actual codebase
- [ ] AI agent development patterns comprehensively covered
- [ ] Cost optimization strategies embedded in all relevant sections
- [ ] Integration patterns between tools clearly documented
- [ ] Validation commands provided for each component
- [ ] Documentation structure supports easy navigation and maintenance

- Style conventions (PEP8, type hints, docstrings)
- Development commands (enhanced with UV and tool-specific commands)
- Git branching strategy (develop → main)

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Documentation Validation

```bash
# Validate markdown syntax
markdownlint CLAUDE.md

# Validate configuration file references
python -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('pyproject.toml', 'rb'))"
docker-compose config --quiet

# Validate documentation structure
python scripts/validate_claude_md.py --check-structure

# Expected: No syntax errors, all references valid
```

### Level 2: Tool Configuration Validation

```bash
# Validate each tool configuration mentioned in CLAUDE.md
uv sync && uv --version                    # Package management
docker-compose ps                          # Container services
cd data_stack/meltano && meltano --version # Meltano ELT
cd data_stack/dbt && dbt --version         # dbt transformations

# Test database connections
python -c "import duckdb; duckdb.connect('/data/duckdb/analytics.db').execute('SELECT 1')"

# Expected: All tools accessible and configured correctly
```

### Level 3: Integration Testing

```bash
# Test AI agent framework
python -c "from agents.base_agent import BaseAgent; print('Agent framework operational')"

# Test tool integrations
python -c "
from tools.duckdb_tools import DuckDBTools
from tools.meltano_tools import MeltanoTools
print('Tool integrations operational')
"

# Test development workflow
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy .
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Expected: All integrations functional, development workflow intact
```

### Level 4: End-to-End Data Stack Validation

```bash
# Test complete data pipeline
./scripts/deploy_stack.py --validate-only
./scripts/validate_pipeline.py --comprehensive

# Test AI agent workflows
python -c "
import asyncio
from agents.data_stack_engineer import DataStackEngineer
from agents.base_agent import WorkflowRequest

async def test():
    agent = DataStackEngineer()
    request = WorkflowRequest(user_prompt='Check system health')
    result = await agent.execute_task(request)
    print(f'Agent operational: {result.status}')

asyncio.run(test())
"

# Expected: Complete data stack operational, agents functional
```

### Level 5: Documentation Quality and Usability

```bash
# Test documentation completeness
python scripts/claude_md_coverage_analyzer.py --comprehensive

# Validate all examples and commands in documentation
python scripts/validate_claude_examples.py --execute-all

# Check for broken links and references
python scripts/check_documentation_links.py

# Performance test with realistic data
./scripts/performance_test_data_stack.py --validate-targets

# Expected: 100% coverage, all examples work, performance targets met
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Don't lose existing valuable development patterns and guidelines
- ❌ Don't create generic documentation - use real project configurations
- ❌ Don't document tools not actually used in the project
- ❌ Don't skip cost optimization considerations for any tool
- ❌ Don't forget to include troubleshooting for complex integrations
- ❌ Don't make sections too long - maintain readability with clear subsections
- ❌ Don't skip validation commands - every tool needs executable checks
- ❌ Don't ignore interdependencies between tools and services
- ❌ Don't forget to document environment-specific configurations

## Quality Assurance Strategy

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Document all 45+ components with real examples
- **Practical Examples**: All examples from actual codebase configurations
- **Maintenance Framework**: Clear ownership and update procedures
- **User Testing**: Validate with new developer onboarding experience
- **Performance Impact**: Ensure documentation supports $50/month cost target

**Confidence Score: 9/10** - Comprehensive research, real codebase examples, extensive tool coverage, and validated integration patterns ensure high success probability for creating production-ready data stack documentation.
