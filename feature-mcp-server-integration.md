## FEATURE:

- Comprehensive MCP server search of official integrations and community integrations aligning with the data stack compontents
- also implement this as an mcp server: https://github.com/disler/quick-data-mcp/tree/main
- build a method for testing all of these integrations
- after integrations complete, make modifications to the agents to use these integrations

## EXAMPLES:

-

## DOCUMENTATION:

- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#-community-servers

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- its possible that through just these mcp integrations we may have all the prompts, tools, and models we need for providing these to our multiple agents to perform their tasks.
